# OmaniBolt   

OmaniBolt is a **learning project** aimed at building a backend similar to **Bolt AI**. The goal is to understand how to interact with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and integrate them into a mobile application.  

## 🛠️ Project Purpose  
- Learn how to design and implement a backend for AI-powered applications.  
- Explore **LLM API interactions** and how responses are handled.  
- Build a **mobile app interface** that connects to the backend, similar to Bolt AI.  

## 📌 Project Scope  
- This project focuses on **backend development** using **Node.js and WebSockets**.  
- The mobile app will interact with the backend for real-time AI responses.  
- It is not intended to be a full production-ready clone but a hands-on learning experience.
